# üõ°Ô∏è Toxic Speech Classifier ‚Äì HateShield

A machine learning-based NLP pipeline to detect toxic and hate speech in Filipino social media content. Built using TF-IDF vectorization, Naive Bayes classification, and K-Means clustering with t-SNE visualization.

## Project Overview

Social media is filled with both constructive dialogue and harmful speech. This project tackles the growing need for automated toxic speech detection using machine learning, with a focus on Filipino text data.

We built a supervised classification model and evaluated its performance using real-world data containing toxic and non-toxic social media posts.

Deploy as a web API (FastAPI or Streamlit)

Implement real-time moderation dashboard

## Dataset Source

This project uses Filipino hate speech datasets sourced from:
https://github.com/imperialite/filipino-tiktok-hatespeech/tree/main
A collection of annotated hate speech and offensive language data from TikTok comments in Filipino.

The data includes training, testing, and validation sets labeled as toxic or non-toxic. Full credit to the original authors for providing high-quality annotated data.
